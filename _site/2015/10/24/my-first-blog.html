    <p>I always blame myself for grabbing stuff from open source community and developers’ blogs, while never contributing back to society. Now I I decided to change, and thanks to <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, I finally launched my own light-weight blog site, and hosted online without worrying about domain or server whatever. I will start writing things which hopefully could benefit others. Let’s begin with the layout of this blog site. I referenced the canvas design from <a href="http://evanyou.me" target="_blank">Evan You</a> (author of Vue.js), and Jekyll site structure from <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io" target="_blank">Tom Preston-Werner</a> (founder of GitHub). Feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/MuhanZou/muhanzou.github.io" target="_blank">blog repository</a> and see how I coded the entire site. 
<br /><br />
A bit about myself, I am from China (Beijing), and currently working in U.S as a full-stack engineer. I mainly use Ruby on Rails as the server side, and frameworks like React.js for the front. Other than working, I focus on learning front-end technologies as they are extremely fascinating and evolving so rapidly.
<br /><br />
For my personal life, I have a great family in Beijing as I normally visited them 2-3 times a year, and a beatiful wife, Xuelin, my high school classmate. Things I enjoy are travelling, movies, foods and etc, but coming first would be daily Gym workout and coffee (all kinds).</p>
